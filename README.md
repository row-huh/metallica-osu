# Rhythm Game But Specifically for metallica
#### (For absolutely no real reason)


TODO
- Figure out how to time each note, what could the data structure (or idk whatever) to store each note + the letter associated with it + the time it's supposed to be played at + the valid time window to hit it at
- Figure out whether each note will be connected to a key or a timeframe - where it just plays anyway
- Implement notes falling down animation
- Implement scoring systems
-
